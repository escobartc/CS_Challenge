# Computer science challenge
I am Carlos, and this is the repository that contains the solutions for different algorithm exercises.
I am not good at doing this kind of live coding challenges but it was an interesting activity.
As someone with experience as an android developer, the proposed solutions were developed in kotlin (for the easy and medium).

* [Easy](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1173549575/)
* [Medium](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1177278915/)


* The critical connections algorithm was the hardest excersise, I tried doing it but at the end the solution provided was kind of an adaptation from the Tarjans algorithm pseudocode, so I adapted a Tarjans algorithm to code to try understand it and added to the repo but is not a 100% solution by me.
