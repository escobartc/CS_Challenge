# Computer science challenge
I am Carlos, and this is the repository that contains the solutions for different algorithm exercises.
I am not good at doing this kind of live coding challenges but it was an interesting activity.
As someone with experience as an android developer, the proposed solutions were developed in kotlin (for the easy and medium).
