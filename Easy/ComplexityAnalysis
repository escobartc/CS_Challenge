# **For this solution we consider:**

**In time complexity ‚è≤:**

1. We iterate through the entire input array once, which has a length of \( n \). Inside the loop, each operation such as checking if the current element is not equal to zero, assigning values to array elements, and incrementing the index, takes constant time. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is \( O(n) \).

---

**In space complexity üñ•:**

1. The function doesn't use any extra data structures that grow with the size of the input array. It only uses a constant amount of extra space for variables such as index and loop iterators. Thus, the space complexity of the function is \( O(1) \) (constant space).
